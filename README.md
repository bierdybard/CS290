# Database project

The client was bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Client
Source dir: src
To build: yarn run build

## Server
Source dir: server
To run: yarn run apiserver

Client will build into ./build which is statically served by the server, so in order to serve production assets, build and then run the api server.
